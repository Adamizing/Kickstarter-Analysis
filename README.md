# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
  ### In this project I had to help a playwright, Louise, get a better look at other plays around the world. Louise kickstarted a play called "Fever" and came up short on reaching her goal. I get to help Louise get a better understanding on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
  #### The purpose of this challenge was to help Louise see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This could help Louise in the future if she wanted to try again or wants to try with a new play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### First, I wanted to compare the outcomes of plays with the initial launch date. I wanted to see the best months to launch a play in the form of a line graph. (This Graph has been provided). April through July was the best time to start based on the graph. May to April was a steady jump from 71 to 111 successful plays. with July being back around to 87 successful launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  #### Second, I looked at the correlation between the set goals of plays in relation to the percentage of success. All though there wasn’t a success rate higher than 80%. The success rate was higher than failed rate with a lower set goal of $10,000 to $14,999. After that it was a 50/50 chance of success or failing. There was a spike in success rate around $40,000 to $44,999 range with a 66.67%. Setting a goal higher than that would most likely result in failing.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  #### Third, challenges I faced with this data set. I didn’t have too many problems with the data set because we looked at only the theater/plays aspect of it. I didn’t find any big outliers that affected the graphs, or the data sets created. If there were outliers or to look at the whole set, we could run into duplicates that could skew the data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  ### Louise launched her play in June which was on a steady decline into July. While June had 100 successful plays and July only had 87. Not the biggest drop but we wanted to shoot for the best chance of coming out successful. If Louise could have launched in mid-April or the start of, May I believe there would have been a higher chance of success.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  ### While Louise goal was just shy of $3,000 that seemed like the highest chance of success. The category of $1,000 - $4,999 had a total of 388 total successful launches. The percent of launched plays that meet the goal in that range was 72.66%. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  ### Some limitations of this data set could have been things such as who put the plays on or if it was a sequel of an already successful play from the past. There could be some big name plays that would have succeeded no matter what the set goal was.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  ### I made a box and whisker plot in hopes to find some outliers in the data provide. While I did see some that pasted the upper quartile there wasn’t anything that really stood out to me.
